        Why I love working with Java
    </h1>
    <p>
        Some context: I'm currently a student (at the moment of writing this post).<br> 
        I've worked with Java for only 3 years (and counting). The other languages<br>
        I have relative proficiency with are: C#, Python, Javascript. I've used<br>
        these languages out of a necessity. C# for game development, Python for <br>
        my AI/ML courses, and Javascript because every single company lists it <br>
        as a requirement. In my 3rd year of CS in my Competitive Programming <br>
        class, a lot of Java's lackings were front and center. I've always <br>
        been aware of the language's verbosity but it's never really bothered me.<br>
        The verbosity was a necessity because it explained the syntax so well. <br>
        Java's syntax has been the simplest experience for me to learn (this is <br>
        probably bias). There's many memes about needing 10 lines of code for a <br>
        simple "Hello World" but these memes only hold comedic value because <br>
        intellisense trivializes the hassle. How many of us genuinely type out<br>
        public static void main (String args[]). Heck, even my university professor<br>
        at the time didn't remember this line. Before intellisense this must have<br>
        been a huge negative but now? The magical tab button erases this issue entirely.<br>
        <br>
        It was when I had to take input for every single Competitive Programming problem<br>
        did I start to see the flaws of Java. Having to type out (quite literally) 30-50<br>
        lines of code JUST to take input was brain-numbing. I would spend 5-10 minutes just<br>
        taking input for every single problem. That shaves off so much of your time + ruins<br>
        the workflow severly. It was at this moment that I began to seee problems with Java's<br>
        verbosity. Intellinsense made the problem a lot easier (Ctrl-C & Ctrl-V) were the<br>
        real saviers but still. It was a negative. Comparing Java code to C code really <br>
        put into perspective just how much more code I was writing. Their solutions were<br>
        so much more simplistic and minimalistic than Java code. Even the most optimized<br>
        Java code would have an additional 30-50 lines. That's a lot of code. Heck, I've<br>
        often had the actual algorithm fit into MUCH fewer lines than the Scanner code.<br>
        <br>
        Despite this realization, I still prefer Java. Why? I said it before. It's <br>
        because of how much sense the synatx makes. I can't stress enough how important <br>
        it is that WHY a language is written the way it is makes sense. I should know <br>
        why I'm having to declare a new in this line or use Integer instead of int here.<br>
        If it doesn't make sense then it's not a good language. If we humans cannot piece <br>
        together the reason for a language needing these components, how can we be expected<br>
        to efficiently use these components to solve problems? I'll spend my time in <br>
        documentation hell trying to figure out how to implement a specific function <br>
        instead of solving the actual problem. This may sound like an exaggeration but <br>
        this is the exact problem Javascript developers often run into.
        <br>
        You may be wondering why I don't prefer Python instead. It's a very very simple<br>
        language to use, especially for someone with programming knowledge but I ran<br>
        into a differnt problem with it. I found that the language had too much "magic"<br>
        going on. What does that mean? Well, there's so much information you don't have<br>
        to specify to Python. You don't need to pre-define sizes for example and as a <br>
        Java developer, that really bothered me. What do you mean you'll figure out at <br>
        run-time? Why are you doing that, that's so unnecessary. Whilst this may seem<br>
        like a + point (and it is for many), it wasn't for me because visualizingh <br>
        how much space I needed for an array was important to solving the problem.<br>
        I was used to solving problems with that perspective. This isn't so much as<br>
        fault of the language as it is of the user but I never once claimed these <br>
        languages have an inherent issue. I am just listing why I love working with<br>
        Java, not why you love it or why you should. These experiences have <br>
        reminded me of one important thing. We are all very different. We think <br>
        about problems differently, we learn differently and we store information<br>
        differently. Whislst most have a very positive experience with Python after<br>
        getting programming language, I found the language to be very difficult to<br>
        accustom myself to. And that's fine. I was able to pickup what it was about<br>
        the language that I was struggling to come to terms with. And the ability<br>
        to deduce that is far more valuable.
